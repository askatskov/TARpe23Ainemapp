    <h1>Scrum Development Model</h1>
   
    <p>
        Scrum is an agile development model aimed at fast, 
        flexible, and continuous software development. The Scrum process focuses 
        on achieving goals set by teams in iterations.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Sprint Planning: The Scrum process begins with sprint planning. 
                A sprint is a period (usually 2-4 weeks) during which the team 
                completes a specific task. At the beginning of the sprint, priorities 
                and tasks are set.
            </li>
            <li>
                Task Execution: During the sprint, developers and other team members 
                carry out their tasks according to priorities. This process involves coding, 
                testing, and other development activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Daily Scrum Meetings: Every day, there is a short, usually 
                15-minute meeting where team members share their progress, 
                issues, and plans. This helps the team stay aligned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, a sprint review is held, 
                where developed features are presented and feedback is gathered. 
                This helps the team make better decisions in the next sprints.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprint Retrospective: At the end of the sprint, a retrospective is held, 
                where the team discusses what went well and what needs improvement. 
                The goal is continuous improvement and process optimization.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The Scrum model focuses on continuous collaboration, quick responses 
            to changes, and iterative development, allowing software to be constantly 
            improved and adapted according to user needs 
            and feedback.</p>

        <p><strong>Scrum vs. Other Development Models</p></strong>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <p><strong>Scrum<p></strong>
                <li>
                    Focuses on teamwork and quick iterations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Work is divided into sprints, and at the end of each sprint, the system can be enhanced and improved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The goal is continuous feedback and development according to user 
                    requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Example: In the first sprint, we develop only the user login 
                    feature. In the second sprint, we add search. In the third sprint, 
                    we enhance profile display.

                <p><strong>Incremental Development</p></strong>
                <li>
                    Focuses on adding new functionalities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each increment adds a new feature that is independently 
                    functional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The goal is to grow the system by gradually adding new components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Example: The first increment adds login, the second increment 
                    adds profiles, and the third adds messaging.
                </li>
