  <h1>Lean Software Development</h1>

  <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Lean software development is a concept that emphasizes optimizing efficiency and minimizing waste in the software development process. This approach has its roots in the Lean manufacturing movement of the 1980s. However, it is now considered an integral part of the Agile software development methodology.
