    <h1>12 Agile Principles</h1>

    <p>
        The Agile Software Development methodology is based on 
        12 core principles that guide teams in delivering efficient, 
        high-quality, and flexible software solutions. These 
        principles emphasize collaboration, adaptability, and 
        continuous improvement.
    </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software</strong>
                Continuous delivery of working software ensures customer 
                satisfaction and allows for ongoing feedback and improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development</strong>
                Agile processes embrace change to ensure that the product 
                meets the customer's current needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deliver working software frequently</strong>
                Frequent delivery of small, functional portions of the software 
                allows the customer to see progress and provide feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project</strong>
                Regular collaboration ensures that the development team stays 
                aligned with the customer's needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Build projects around motivated individuals</strong>
                A motivated, well-supported team is more likely to produce 
                high-quality work efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential</strong>
                Focusing on simple solutions reduces unnecessary work and 
                complexity, helping the team to stay agile and focused.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams</strong>
                Empowering teams to make decisions leads to more innovative 
                solutions and better designs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective</strong>
                Continuous improvement is a key tenet of Agile, with teams 
                regularly assessing and refining their processes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility</strong>
                High standards of technical quality make it easier to adapt 
                to future changes and minimize defects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Agile processes promote sustainable development</strong>
                The goal is to maintain a constant pace that allows teams to 
                sustain high levels of productivity over the long term.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Working software is the primary measure of progress</strong>
                The ultimate goal is the delivery of functioning software 
                that provides value to the customer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Agile encourages face-to-face communication</strong>
                Effective communication between team members leads to faster 
                decision-making and better problem-solving.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>These 12 Agile principles help teams develop flexible, 
            high-quality software solutions while ensuring continuous 
            improvement and customer satisfaction.</p>

    <p><strong>Positive Aspects<p></strong>
    <p>
        The Agile methodology offers several advantages, such as the 
        ability to quickly adapt to changes, the importance of frequent 
        feedback, and a focus on continuous improvement. These principles 
        help teams prioritize customer satisfaction and produce high-quality 
        products efficiently.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Negative Aspects<p></strong>
    <p>
        While Agile can be effective for many projects, it may be
        challenging for large-scale projects where constant change 
        and frequent iteration are difficult to manage. Additionally, 
        teams can become too reliant on collaboration, making it hard 
        to maintain consistency in certain scenarios.
