  <h1>FDD (Feature-Driven Development)</h1>

  <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Feature-Driven Development (FDD) is a model within Agile development focused on delivering high-quality, client-valued features in a structured and methodical way. As Agile methodologies have become popular for their flexibility and focus on collaboration, FDD stands out due to its precise focus on features that directly meet client needs. This makes FDD particularly useful for projects with clear requirements and a desire for rapid delivery of working software.
